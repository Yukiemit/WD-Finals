            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <h1>YUKI EMIT</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm a 1st year Information Technology student at FEU Tech, specializing in web and mobile application development. From the moment I wrote my first line of code, I knew I had found my passion. My journey in the tech world has been a thrilling adventure, filled with endless opportunities to learn and create. I am deeply fascinated by the ever-evolving landscape of technology and am committed to staying ahead of the curve, whether it's mastering the latest programming languages or exploring innovative ways to solve complex problems.</p>
            <p>Coding isn't just a skill for me, it's an obsession. I thrive on the challenge of turning ideas into functional, user-friendly applications. My time at FEU Tech has equipped me with a solid foundation in both theory and practical skills, allowing me to tackle real-world projects with confidence. As I continue to grow and develop my expertise, I am excited about the future and the endless possibilities that lie ahead in the world of web and mobile development.</p>
            <p>As what you see on the Home page this is one of my favourite quote.</p>
            <h3>“If there’s one thing you learn by working on a lot of different Web sites, it’s that almost any design idea–no matter how appallingly bad–can be made usable in the right circumstances, with enough effort.”
                ― Steve Krug</h3>
